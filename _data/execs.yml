    I am a third year Electrical Engineering student 
    with a passion for the application of engineering 
    to entrepreneurial endeavours. The IEEE Student Branch 
    at UOIT provides a myriad of opportunities to those
    studying in STEM fields, as it provides excellent 
    opportunities to gain practical skills, network with 
    peers and industry professionals as well as gain exposure
    to industry. I am humbled to be this year’s Chair, and I 
    look forward to another successful year for our IEEE Student 
    Branch.

    I’m a third year Electrical Engineering student and I will 
    be organizing which events to have during the year alongside 
    many of the directors. My goal for our student branch is to 
    promote IEEE through events, increase our activity in engineering 
    outreach and continue our success at the university.

  position: Director

    I am a second year Electrical Engineering student with a 
    passion for robotics and DIY electronics. I am responsible 
    for managing the McNaughton Resource Centre, helping provide
    students the opportunity to learn about applications of 
    Electrical Engineering outside the classroom. In university 
    labs, it is often difficult to find tinkering time or space
    where you can work on your own projects. The McNaughton
    centre gives students a more laid back, learn at your own 
    pace environment. You can often find me soldering, hacking 
    around with an Arduino board, or taking something apart and 
    modifying it, attempting to improve upon it. It is a great 
    honor to be working with this year’s executive team, and I 
    look forward to the bright future of the IEEE Student Branch 
    at UOIT.
