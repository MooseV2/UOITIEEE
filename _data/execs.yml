    I am a third year Electrical Engineering student with a 
    passion for robotics and DIY electronics. I am responsible 
    for managing internal operations and coordinating meetings, etc. 
    I also assist with the operations of the McNaughton Centre, helping 
    to provide students with the opportunity to learn outside the classroom. 
    In university labs, it is often difficult to find tinkering time or space
    where you can work on your own projects. The McNaughton
    centre gives students a more laid back, learn at your own 
    pace environment. You can often find me soldering, hacking 
    around with an Arduino board, or taking something apart and 
    modifying it, attempting to improve upon it. It is a great 
    honor to be working with the executive team again this year, and I 
    look forward to the bright future of the IEEE Student Branch 
    at UOIT.
