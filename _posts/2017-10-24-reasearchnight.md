<p>The IEEE Student Branch at UOIT is hosting its Third Annual Research Showcase!</p>

<p>Professors and graduate students in the Faculty of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering (ECSE) will speak their research. They will also be discussing how the knowledge you are gaining in the classroom is applied in the industry, and how its developments are making a change today.</p>

<p>This is a great oppurtunity for anyone looking to become a part of the research community at UOIT. This event is open to anyone, and the first two rows will be specially reserved for IEEE members! Please RSVP at https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/ieee-uoit-student-branch-15410053531</p>

<p>The event takes place on October 24th 6pm to 9:30pm in ERC 1096.</p>
